Entire codebase works, supabase **shutdown my database** cause it was inactive so it just doesn't work online as of right now <br>
### tech used 
supbase SDK
tailwindCSS
VueJS (mostly forthe VueRouter)

### updates
1) changed the entire design of the front page, I like the new design WAYYYY better. (some design inspiration taken from junedays but coded the entire thing myself which was a pain in d butt) <br>
